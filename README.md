Introduction
------------

Thats not just another autocomplete plugin.
I made it because i needed it to work like a dom select element and because i wanted it to be flexible in a way that i could use anything as the autocomplete list.
This plugin can also share the same list element, in a way that it will inject just one dom element on the document if you create more than one autocomplete instance in the same page.

How to use
----------

	#JAVASCRIPT
	<script type="text/javascript">
		var data = [
			{"value": 0, "text": "Brazil"},
			{"value": 1, "text": "Ajax"},
		];

		var autocomplete = new Meio.Autocomplete($('text_input_id'), data, {
			selectOnTab: false,
			onNoItemsToList: function(elements){
				elements.field.node.highlight('#ff0000');
			},
			filter: {
				type: 'contains',
				path: 'text'
			}
		});
		
	</script>
